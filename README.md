## About Milky Way Marvel
Welcome to Milky Way Marvels, an exciting new NFT game where you can explore the vast expanse of the galaxy in search of hidden planets and rare treasures. As a space explorer, your mission is to travel to different star systems, scan planets to discover their unique characteristics, and earn rewards for your discoveries. Each planet you find will be a unique NFT from the Milky Way Marvels collection, with its own set of attributes and rarity level. The game will feature a dynamic, interactive map of the galaxy, where you can navigate to different star systems and planets. You can use your scanner to analyze the planet's atmosphere, composition, and other key characteristics, which will determine its rarity level and potential rewards. As you explore the galaxy and collect new planets, you can trade them with other players or use them to level up your own spaceship and equipment. You can also compete in challenges and events to earn special rewards and unlock new areas of the galaxy.


## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template next-typescript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add environment variables. Check the `.env.example` file for all the environment variables required and add it to `.env.local` file or set them up on your hosting provider.

## Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
